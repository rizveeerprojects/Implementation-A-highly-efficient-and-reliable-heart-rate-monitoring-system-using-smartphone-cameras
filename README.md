An implementation of paper entitled "A highly efficient and reliable heart rate monitoring system using smartphone cameras". This is an implentation for a project. Not verified by the authors of the paper. 

# How to Run 
      1. In the "directory_prefix" variable give the directory where the frames are, numbered as 'frame0.jpg', 'frame1.jpg'  .... etc. 
      2. Set the "number_of_frames" variable with the the number of frames in the directory. 
      3. The Calculated ppg intesity values (according to the paper) will be the output as as list in 'ppg_points_r', also the intensity values will be 
      set in the output file as csv format specified in "output_file" variable.
      4. Then the HR (heart rate) will be calculated and reported as per the parameters (window_length, sampling_freq, T)
